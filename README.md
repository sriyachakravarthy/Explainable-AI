# Explainable AI with Shapley Value

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of **Shapley values** for **model interpretability** in machine learning. Shapley values provide a fair method to explain the contribution of each feature to a model's prediction, offering a deeper understanding of how machine learning models make decisions.

## Key Concepts

- **Shapley Values**: A concept from cooperative game theory that assigns a fair contribution score to each feature based on its impact on the modelâ€™s output.
- **Explainable AI**: A field of AI aimed at making models and predictions transparent and interpretable to humans.
